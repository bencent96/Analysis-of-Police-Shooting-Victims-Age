# Analysis-of-Police-Shooting-Victims-Age
Statistical analysis of police shooting victims' ages to examine differences based on demographics and race. This project tests if the average age of victims deviates from 40 and compares minority and non-minority groups using hypothesis testing and t-statistics. Implemented in R.
Overview

This project analyzes the ages of police shooting victims in the United States, focusing on racial and demographic differences. It aims to answer two key research questions:

    Is the average age of victims significantly different from 40 years old?
    Is the average age of minority victims different from non-minority victims?

The analysis utilizes data from the shootings.csv dataset, which records police shootings across America.
