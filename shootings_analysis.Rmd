# Introduction

This analysis aims to explore whether there are significant differences in the ages of police shooting victims, based on race and general demographics. We will address two research questions:

1. Is the average age of victims significantly different from 40 years old?
2. Is the average age of minority victims different from non-minority victims?

The data used for this analysis comes from the `shootings.csv` file, which records police shootings in America.

# Question 1: Is the average age of victims significantly different from 40?

A recent census study indicates that the average age of Americans is 40 years old. We will conduct a hypothesis test at the α = 0.05 significance level to determine whether the average age of victims is significantly different from 40.

## Hypothesis

- **Null hypothesis (H₀):** The mean age of victims is 40.
  \[
  H_0: \mu = 40
  \]
- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁):** The mean age of victims is not 40.
  \[
  H_1: \mu \neq 40
  \]

## Data Preparation and Summary

We load the dataset and compute descriptive statistics for the age of victims.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Read the dataset
file_path <- "shootings.csv"
shootings_data <- read_csv(file_path)

# Filter age data and remove NA values
age_data <- na.omit(shootings_data$age)

# Summary statistics for age
summary(age_data)

# Question 1
# Step 1: Calculate sample statistics
sample_mean <- mean(age_data)
sample_sd <- sd(age_data)
n <- length(age_data)

# Hypothesized mean (population mean)
mu_0 <- 40

# Step 2: Compute the t-statistic
t_statistic <- (sample_mean - mu_0) / (sample_sd / sqrt(n))

# Step 3: Critical value for two-tailed test at alpha = 0.05
alpha <- 0.05
t_critical <- qt(1 - alpha/2, df = n-1)

# Step 4: Compute the p-value
p_value <- 2 * pt(-abs(t_statistic), df = n-1)

# Display results
cat("Sample Mean:", sample_mean, "\n")
cat("Sample Standard Deviation:", sample_sd, "\n")
cat("Sample Size:", n, "\n")
cat("T-statistic:", t_statistic, "\n")
cat("Critical Value (t_critical):", t_critical, "\n")
cat("P-value:", p_value, "\n")

# Decision
if (abs(t_statistic) > t_critical) {
  cat("Reject the null hypothesis: The mean age is significantly different from 40.\n")
} else {
  cat("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: No significant difference from 40.\n")
}

# Question 2
# Step 1: Separate minority and non-minority victims (assuming 'White' is non-minority)
minority_data <- shootings_data %>% filter(race != "White") %>% pull(age)
non_minority_data <- shootings_data %>% filter(race == "White") %>% pull(age)

# Remove missing values
minority_data <- na.omit(minority_data)
non_minority_data <- na.omit(non_minority_data)

# Summary statistics for each group
cat("Minority Group - Mean Age:", mean(minority_data), "\n")
cat("Non-Minority Group - Mean Age:", mean(non_minority_data), "\n")

# Step 2: Calculate sample sizes, means, and standard deviations
n1 <- length(minority_data)
n2 <- length(non_minority_data)

mean_minority <- mean(minority_data)
mean_non_minority <- mean(non_minority_data)

sd_minority <- sd(minority_data)
sd_non_minority <- sd(non_minority_data)

# Step 3: Calculate the pooled standard deviation
sp <- sqrt(((n1 - 1) * sd_minority^2 + (n2 - 1) * sd_non_minority^2) / (n1 + n2 - 2))

# Step 4: Calculate the t-statistic
t_statistic <- (mean_minority - mean_non_minority) / (sp * sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2))

# Step 5: Determine the critical value for a two-tailed test at alpha = 0.01
alpha <- 0.01
df <- n1 + n2 - 2
t_critical <- qt(1 - alpha/2, df)

# Step 6: Compute the p-value
p_value <- 2 * pt(-abs(t_statistic), df)

# Display results
cat("T-statistic:", t_statistic, "\n")
cat("Critical Value (t_critical):", t_critical, "\n")
cat("P-value:", p_value, "\n")

# Decision
if (abs(t_statistic) > t_critical) {
  cat("Reject the null hypothesis: Significant difference between minority and non-minority victims' ages.\n")
} else {
  cat("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: No significant difference between the two groups.\n")
}
